Falling Fruit is a game which, to some degree, resembles
"Bird & Beans" (DSiWare).

1.) Controls

Movement is pretty simple:
Left/Right:	Move left and right
Spacebar:	Shoot
Escape:		Quit


2.) Features

So far, I have it pretty well complete (feature-wise). The
Fruit fall, the Frog (I haven't named him yet) moves, and you
can shoot the fruit. I haven't added a scoring system yet, and
there's no menu or configuration options either.


3.) Bugs

There are lots of bugs: The fruit sometimes disappear before
reaching the ground, when you shoot there is a pause (on purpose,
for now), the line representing the frog's tongue isn't drawn
(or is drawn but covered by the background), etc..

If you would like to help fix bugs, checkout the source with git, perform
your modifications, create a patch using git-diff, and send it over. I'll
check to see if it works, and apply it if it does. If you'd like to be
recognized for your contribution, be sure to send me a name and
(optionally) e-mail address with the patch.

If you've found a bug, but don't know how to fix it or don't have time,
create an issue[1] at the github issues page, and I'll see if I can fix it.
Be sure to include as much detail as possible (any error messages, and
steps to reproduce would be helpful).
